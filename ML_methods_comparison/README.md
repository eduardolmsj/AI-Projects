Notebook comparing efficiency of 4 different ai algorithms (knn, naibe bayes, decision tree and mlp) in 10 datasets. 

Made on google colab. Some datasets are imported from scikitlearn and the others were in stored a drive file, but they can be imported locally through the datasets zip file. In case of locally adding the datasets,
comment drive mount section and change the import path at the beggining of each dataset section.
